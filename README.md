## New Life Assembly of God Church Website
of College Place, WA

This github repo holds the code to our church's website. 

I posted the code to github because it will allow me to work on the site
from anywhere and I do hope it can serve as some sort of coding example
to those who are curious.

I am currently working on automatically rendering the sermons uploaded
to Amazon S3 in the "s3" branch.
